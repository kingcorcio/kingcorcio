Youth Development Instructor @ XP Synergy | Mentoring, Communication, Problem Solving

I am a Youth Development Instructor at XP Synergy Companies, where I have been teaching work-related skills and life skills to young adults for over a year. I have a background in intelligence analysis, transportation management, and hazardous materials handling, as well as multiple certifications, including Intelligence Fundamentals Certified Professional (IFPC) and Certified Associates in Project Management (CAPM).

My mission is to use my strength-based and trauma-informed approaches to help participants explore their abilities and career options, prepare for employment, and achieve self-sufficiency. I work closely with an interdisciplinary team to deliver lessons from the Opportunity Now contextualized curriculum, which covers topics such as communication, problem solving, teamwork, and leadership. I also enjoy public speaking and sharing my leadership and training skills developed during my 20-year military career in the Air Force. üòé
